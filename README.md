ActiveState allows you to update your Svelte application state easily and in real-time from your Rails backend. Its a combination of npm package and ruby gem, that gives you an application-wide Svelte 5 `$state` object, and methods to manipulate this state object using dot-notation.

## In a nutshell

With ActiveState you have an application-wide state object like this:

```svelte
<script>
import { State } from 'activestate'
console.log(State.projects.321.name)
</script>
```

and you can update it in real-time from your Rails backend like this:

```rb
ProjectChannel[project].state("projects", project.id, "name").set("My awesome project")
```

## Detailed example

Let's assume you have a web app and would like to display real-time messages to a specific user. This can be easily done with ActiveState by pushing new messages to a centralized state object as they happen. Let's have a look:

### Set up

First, we of course need a channel that we can subscribe to:

```rb
# user_channel.rb
class UserChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_for current_user
  end
end
```

Then, inside your component, set up a subscription and iterate over `state.messages`.

```svelte
<script>
import { subscribe, State } from 'activestate'
import { onDestroy } from 'svelte'

// Set up a subscription to the UserChannel
const unsubscribe = subscribe('UserChannel', {user_id: something})

// Don't forget to unsubscribe when the component is destroyed
onDestroy(unsubscribe)

// Iinitialize it with an empty array
State.messages ||= []
const messages = $derived(State.messages)
</script>

{#each messages as message}
  <p>{message.text}</p>
{/each}
```

Now you can server-side push directly into `State.messages` through the UserChannel:

```rb
# Somewhere in your Ruby code:
UserChannel[some_user].state('messages').push({id: 4, text: "Hello from Ruby"})
```

And update the message:

```rb
UserChannel[some_user].state('messages').upsert({id: 4, text: "Changed text"})
```


## Mutating state

All state mutations operate on a path. This path can be either specified via dot-notation (eg `projects.421.name`), or as an array (eg. `["projects", project.id, "name"]`).

ActiveState comes with 4 built-in mutators: `set`, `assign`, `upsert`, and `delete` (by the way, when did people start to say "mutating"):

#### `set(data)`

```rb
UserChannel[some_user].state('current_user.name').set("John")
```

Replaces the value of `current_user.name` with `John`.

#### `merge(data)`

```rb
UserChannel[some_user].state('current_user').assign({name: 'new name'})
```

Uses `Object.assign` to merge the passed object onto `current_user`.

#### `upsert(data, key = "id")`

```rb
UserChannel[some_user].state('current_user.notices').upsert([{id: 4, name: "new name"}])
```

This iterates over the array in `current_user.notices`, and performs an upsert using specified key

#### `delete({key: val})`

If called on an array, it iterates over the array and deletes all entries who's keys match the provided object.

#### `delete(key)`

If called on an object, it deletes they provided key on the object

### Native mutators

You can also call functions that "natively" exist on objects in the state. For example, if you have an array in `current_user.notices`, you can call its native `push` function:

```ruby
UserChannel[some_user].state('current_user.notices').push "next chunk"
```

### Custom mutators

You can also define custom methods to mutate your state.

```js
import { registerMutator, State } from 'activestate'

registerMutator('append', function(currentValue, data) {
  return currentValue.concat(data)
})

<p>
Here is a very long string: {State.long_string}
</p>
```

```ruby
UserChannel[some_user].state('long_string').append "next chunk"
```

### Send using a specific connection

The `state` method is also available on a Channel instance. That means that you can update Svelte stores through a specific connection, instead of broadcasting to all subscribers:

```rb
# user_channel.rb
class UserChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_for current_user
    state('current_user').set(current_user.as_json)
  end
end
```

### SSR

When using ActiveState in an SSR context, the server-side javascript process is usually shared between requests. Therefore it is of importance to call `reset()` before or after rendering, to clear the state and avoid any data leakage between requests.

```js
import { reset } from 'activestate'

reset()

// ... rest of code comes here
```

## FAQ

### Is it smart to place all state into a global state object?

Not sure. Svelte 5 introduced [fine-grained reactivity](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/fine-grained-reactivity-in-svelte-5/) for objects declared with `$state`. That means that even if your object becomes huge with deeply nested data, it should not have any impact on performance. So its worth trying to do things this way.

## Installation

### Ruby gem

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activestate'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

### Npm package

Install the package:

    $ npm i -D activestate
